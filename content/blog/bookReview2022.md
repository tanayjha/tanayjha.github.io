In the January of the year 2022, I thought of setting a goal for myself with regards to the number of books I read in a year. During my school days, I was an avid reader and was very interested in reading fiction. However, with the JEE preparation (starting from class 11th) most of that stopped. Since then, I have read multiple books on and off but never got into a habit of reading regularly. 
I thought a target of reading 25 books in the year although a little ambitious, might be a decent one. I had not decided on a book list or anything but wanted to focus on non-fiction. Over the years I find myself more fullfilled if I read a non-fiction book rather than a fiction one. 
I watched a few youtube videos and found an interesting advice about the art of reading which I was not aware of earlier which holds true for non-fiction. Most of the non-fiction books could be condensed into a blog post. They have a few points which the author wants to drive home and then they try to drill those points in the mind of the readers using various techniques/stories. So for non-fiction books, it generally doesn't make sense to read them cover to cover. 
This concept is something I am still wrapping my head around. I am accustomed to reading books without skipping any page even if it is done for a formality. However, I quickly realised that this practice is really hard to keep up for non-fiction. They are generally not as gripping as fiction. In fact, people also suggest to simply skip over chapters you don't want to read in non-fiction. This is something I still can't do. However, I guess I have got pretty good at skipping over paragraphs/pages I don't find particularly engaging.
Another very powerful concept, which I believe I agree with, but still haven't accepted fully is that it is the duty of an author to capture your attention for the entire duration of the book. If they are not able to do so, you can just put the book down and not read it. You are not obligated to read it. 
One thing that I have realised however is that not all books can be read at all points in your life. Some books only make sense when their time has come and when you are ready for them. So it is ok to not read a book until you feel ready for it. 

Well that was a lot of blabbering, let's get to what were the books I read. I also thought of writing one or two lines of what was the takeaway for me from that book (if I still remember any). I will be honest and say that most of the takeaways are probably something which I have not started applying in my daily life but I definitely should. And maybe that would be something I would like to take with me in the new year.

I read 22 books in total. 3 short of target but that doesn't bother me much. In fact I am pretty happy with my result and even more happy since I know that there was a potential to read a lot more. I kind of dropped the ball towards the end of the year. Need to pick it up again. So here goes...

## Books I read

1. **[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.in/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear/dp/1847941834)** - Amazing book. Did a whole [blog post](https://tanayjha.github.io/blog/atomic-habits/) on the learnings from it.

2. **[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/0349413681)** - This book inspires me to set a time table for myself like I used to do during my schooldays. However, instead of dividing it into subjects, it will be much more coarse and will consist of chunks of time where I give undivided attention to the task at hand. And obviously combine with this the approach of scheduling the hardest tasks you want to achieve in the day first. More importantly, this book introduced me (through another series of threads) to Lex Fridman and his podcast which have taught me a lot of things.

3. **[Siddhartha](https://www.amazon.in/Siddhartha-Hermann-Hesse/dp/817234368X/)** - A spiritual book depicting the journey of a boy going from a saint to a sinner back to a saint (away from worldly desires). It re-inforces the power of how a sense of detachement can allow you to do the task at hand the best you can and not be worried about its result.  

4. **[Ikigai](https://www.amazon.in/Ikigai-H%C3%A9ctor-Garc%C3%ADa/dp/178633089X)** - The story of Okinawa and how people there are so happy. I guess my takeaway was that they lead a simple life, eat healthy and have a lot of friends to talk to (or human interaction). These are the secrets of a good and long life.

5. **[Doesn't hurt to Ask](https://www.amazon.in/Doesnt-Hurt-Ask-Questions-Communicate/dp/0593138910)** - I don't think I completed this book. It is from a lawyer trying to showcase from various examples of how asking even dumb questions can sometimes bring out very important information. I agree with the premise. I also believe that if you keep on asking dumb questions, eventually the standard of your questions will improve automatically. It's all about asking the right questions and dumb questions are a start to that journey.

6. **[Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products](https://www.amazon.in/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/0241184835)** - It opened my eyes towards how the different social media apps are all fighting for our attention. Youtube, Instagram, Facebook etc. all have one goal. Keep the users hooked to their product and they employ all means possible to do that. From infinite scroll in instagram, to auto-play/swipe up shorts on youtube/fb, all of these are tricks to keep the users hooked. 

7. **[Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.in/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0241453577)** - Kept this book just below the above as it stresses the importance of getting away from these social media apps. It makes the case of how they destroy creativity which I agree with. It tells us to embrace boredom because that is when we can do something creative. I usually watch a youtube video when I get bored and although I may learn something new from it, I do believe that doing it everytime doesn't allow the chance to be creative and try something new.

8. **[And the Mountains Echoed](https://www.amazon.in/Mountains-Echoed-Khaled-Hosseni/dp/9384898082/)** - One of the few fictions/novels I read. Khalid Hosseni is a magician and I really wanted to read this one. Made me cry as always.

9. **[The 5AM Revolution](https://www.amazon.in/M-Revolution-High-Achievers-Early/dp/8129147653/)** - Wanted to start waking up early so read this. Not really a big help. What works is will power and even better if you have someone who you can be accountable to and who wakes up with you. Unless of course you have an iron will power :)

10. **[Man's Search For Meaning](https://www.amazon.in/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/1846041244)** - One of the classics. Almost spiritual. Kind of re-inforced the fact what Shawshank Redemption said about hope. One of the best of things. Humans can survive almost anything if they have hope and something to live for.

11. **[Non Violent Communication](https://www.amazon.in/Nonviolent-Communication/dp/9382400230)** - This one is kind of a blur for me. I believe it talked about the importance of not reacting instantly. Take some time to think about your response and structure it appropriately. This can avoid a lot of fights in relationships personal or professional.

12. **[The Psychology Of Money](https://www.amazon.in/PSYCHOLOGY-MONEY-DELUXE-Morgan-Housel/dp/9390166934)** - Need to read this one again. One thing I took from it and applied was that instead of worrying about how the market will perform, which stocks to buy etc. just invest a small amount every month in the market (index funds). You don't have to worry about the performance at all. It is guaranteed that you will get a good return on investment if you are willing to leave your money invested long enough.

13. **[A Walk to Remember](https://www.amazon.in/Walk-Remember-Nicholas-Sparks/dp/0751538949/)** - A love story. Didn't think I would like it initially but it was definitely powerful. The book said at the beginning that you will laugh and then you will cry. Don't say you weren't warned. Well, they were right. 

14. **[Surely You're Joking Mr Feynman](https://www.amazon.in/Feynman-surely-You%E2%80%B2re-joking-Adventures/dp/0393019217/)** - The genius of Richard Feynman. It was a fun read. I kind of skipped around chapters since there is no continuous flow to the book. I remember one story where Einstien, Pauly and other big scientist were present in a room when Feynman was showcasing some work and how without even writing anything they discussed an approach and concluded it will not work. The same conclusion would have taken an average physicist months to make. They were at a whole different level!

15. **[No Execuses!: Power of Self Discipline](https://www.amazon.in/No-Excuses-Self-Discipline-Brian-Tracy/dp/1593156324/)** - Heard it as an audio book mostly while driving and again it's kind of a blur. I have decided to stop doing this now. I mostly hear audiobooks just before sleeping now and it is much more effective. But the overall theme of the book was pretty general. After all the power of self discipline is no secret to anyone. 

16. **[Factfulness](https://www.amazon.in/Factfulness-Reasons-Wrong-Things-Better/dp/1473637465)** - One of the most eye opening books I have read. It shows why statistics are so important and to interpret the data in the right way is an art. It also gives hope as it shows why the world is actually becoming a better place slowly and gradually despite what the media shows.

17. **[Fermat's Last Theorem](https://www.amazon.in/Fermats-Last-Theorem-Simon-Singh/dp/1841157910)** - The story of Andrew Wiles. What a joy to read. It is often said that God sent each of us with a special purpose. Andrew Wiles found his purpose when he was 10. To prove the Fermat's little theorem (unsolved for 200 years) and he fullfilled it even if it appeared to be just a crazy pursuit which seemed impossible to achieve.

18. **[Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.in/Cant-hurt-me-David-goggins/dp/B09JNN5CP6)** - David Goggins. Became a fan. He is kind of an extremist in what he does but I guess it is difficult to inspire others unless you go to the extremes. His short speeches on youtube also insipre me to stay fit and healthy. Truly an inspiration.

19. **[Free Will](https://www.amazon.in/Free-Will-Sam-Harris/dp/1451683405)** - This was a short read triggered by some science vs religion debates I watched on youtube. Sam Harris is an amazing speaker and this book definitely made me think deeply. Free Will is an illusion. I am convinced of this idea after reading the book. However, I guess for a smooth functioning of the society, it is important that we assume that people have free will.

20. **[Almanack Of Naval Ravikant](https://www.amazon.in/Almanack-Naval-Ravikant-Wealth-Happiness/dp/9354893899/)** - Came across Naval via some podcasts. Excellent speaker. This book was a collection of his ideas from different podcasts. Definitely a lot of wisdom in there. Nothing that jumps out specifically to me though right now.

21. **[The Picture Of Dorian Grey](https://www.amazon.in/Picture-Dorian-Gray-Oscar-Wilde/dp/8175993081)** - Wanted to read one of the classics. Was a fan of Oscar Wilde's quotes. This was the only novel he wrote. I did feel that I have lost the patience to read fiction while I read this. But it was a good story. An artist, unknowingly, leaves a piece of himself in his art and if you look close enough you can learn a lot about the artist from his art. 

22. **[Algorithms To Live By](https://www.amazon.in/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/0007547994)** - Amazing book. It has provided me a lot of avenues to explore which have also manifested into some other blogposts as well. Being a software developer, I am specially able to relate to this and how it connects the concepts used in computer science to human life. A lot of the learnings in both of these fields can be cross-applied.


## Goal for Next Year

I am pretty happy with what I achieved in terms of reading this year. There was a potential to do a lot more obviously but I believe consistency is much more important than the quantity. Next year as well, I want to keep a similar target of ~ 25 books. There are a few difficult ones I had put off this year that I want to complete. Two main ones being - Sapiens and Godel Escher Bach (GEB). 
Audiobooks was a good find. I think listening to 30 mins audiobook before sleeping is a good habit that should be inculcated in my routine. Kind of an easy way to read books which may not be very technically investing. 

Hoping I will be back with a similar review next December. See you next year!
